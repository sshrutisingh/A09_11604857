It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and (for the first time) Bangladesh. India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil.[1][2] India's Yuvraj Singh was declared the man of the tournament.[3] This was the first time in World Cup history that two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first time since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature Australia.</p>

There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at the 2003 World Cup (despite a field larger by two teams).

The 16 competing teams were initially divided into four groups, with the two best-performing teams from each group moving on to a "Super 8" format. From this, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and South Africa won through to the semi-finals, with Australia defeating Sri Lanka in the final to win their third consecutive World Cup and their fourth overall. Australia's unbeaten record in the tournament increased their total to 29 consecutive World Cup matches without loss, a streak dating back to 23 May 1999, during the group stage of the 1999 World Cup. The tournament also saw upsets in the first round with tournament favourites India and Pakistan failing to advance past the group stage while Bangladesh, the lowest-ranked Test-playing nation, and Ireland, an associate (non-Test-playing) nation, advanced to the Super 8s.</p>

<p class="text-muted">The 2003 Cricket World Cup (known officially as ICC Cricket World Cup 2003) was the eighth Cricket World Cup, organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 23 March 2003. This edition of the World Cup was the first to be played in Africa.

The tournament featured 14 teams, the largest number in the World Cup's history at the time, playing a total of 54 matches. It followed the format introduced in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, with the teams divided into two groups, and the top three in each group qualifying for the Super Sixes stage.

The tournament saw numerous upsets, with South Africa, Pakistan, West Indies and England all being eliminated at the group stage (South Africa missed by 1 run after misreading the Duckworth-Lewis method rules).[1] England forfeited their match with Zimbabwe, due to the political unrest in the country, which ultimately enabled that team to reach the Super Sixes. Similarly, New Zealand forfeited their match with Kenya, due to security reasons which enabled the latter to reach the semi-finals, the only non-Test playing nation to do so. Another shock wave came two days after the tournament had started, when Shane Warne, at the time one of the game's leading spinners, was sent home in disgrace after testing positive for a banned substance</p>

 <p class="item-intro text-muted">Indian skipper stacks up 889 points, to return to the top of the pile</p>
                 
 <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/VRP_5403.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>Virat Kohli has achieved the highest ever rating by any Indian batsman in One-Day Internationals, going to 889 points at the conclusion of India’s three-match series against New Zealand on Sunday. Kohli also returned to the top of the rankings for ODI batsmen within ten days of losing that position to AB de Villiers.

The previous highest rating achieved by an Indian was 887 points, achieved by Sachin Tendulkar in 1998, and matched by Kohli earlier this year. However, with two centuries in three ODIs against New Zealand and a tally of 263 runs, Kohli not only leap-frogged de Villiers, but history – and Tendulkar – too. He now leads de Villiers by 17 points, with the South African on 872.

Kohli can now set his sights on trying to become just the 12th player to reach the magical 900 point barrier in ODI cricket.

India, however, couldn’t overtake South Africa in the team rankings despite the series win, ending with 119 points and staying at the No.2 spot, behind South Africa who have 121.</p>

<h2 class="text-uppercase">Frustrating defeat, concedes Williamson</h2>
                  
<p class="item-intro text-muted">New Zealand skipper says it was disappointing to not get over the line against an Indian side that is at its best at home.</p>
                  
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/Kane-Williamson.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>It might take a while for New Zealand to get over the six-run loss in the series-deciding third and final One-Day International against India in Kanpur on Sunday (October 29). Chasing 338, New Zealand required 35 off the last 24 balls with six wickets in hand, but the Indian bowlers held their nerve to see their side through to a seventh consecutive bilateral series win in the format.

Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, felt it was an opportunity missed to register its maiden ODI series win in India.

“Naturally you look back at a game, to lose by six runs, having come so close in a big run-chase is frustrating, disappointing,” said Williamson. “But if you sit back and look at the work that was put in in that batting innings to get so close, it is a really promising thing for this batting unit. It is hard to swallow, another decider here in India.

“You can look at different little things, but at the end of the day, there were really good signs. All you can do, I suppose, after any game, whether win or lose, is to move on to your next opportunity. And try to learn from that as best as you can and grow as a team. I am sure these will be our discussions that we will have shortly.”.</p>

 <h2 class="text-uppercase">Bowlers exceptional under pressure, says Rohit</h2>
                  
<p class="item-intro text-muted">India vice-captain attributes Green Park hundred to patience, shot-selection and knowledge of the playing surface</p>
                  
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/PB1D9747.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>Rohit Sharma, the India vice-captain, has been in terrific form in 2017. The stylish right-hand opener scored his fifth One-Day International century of the year and 15th overall in the decider against New Zealand in Kanpur to play a key role in India's nail-biting six-run victory on Sunday (October 29).

Rohit, who was adjudged the Player of the Match for his 138-ball 147, became only the second batsman after Virat Kohli to pile up over 1,000 runs this year. The Mumbai batsman and his captain, who himself went past 9,000 ODI runs, added 230 for the second wicket, their fourth 200-plus partnership, to help India post a commendable 337 for 6 that set up its 2-1 series victory.

Rohit revealed that he was extra careful against New Zealand's new-ball pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult, and that once the shine had gone, he and Kohli, who scored a 106-ball 113, took the attack to the opposition. "When I started off, I was very cautious because I understand the threat of Southee and Boult with the new ball," said Rohit, who also became the sixth Indian batsman to hit 150 sixes in ODIs, on Sunday night. </p>

<h2 class="text-uppercase">Australia gain crucial points, regain top ranking after series win over England</h2>
                                 
 <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/Australia-team.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>Mithali Raj regains top spot after Meg Lanning misses series due to injury; Knight, Healy, Hartley and Schutt among players to attain career-best rankings.
Defending champions Australia’s 2-1 victory over England in the ICC Women’s Championship series has not only helped them garner four useful points but also regain the top spot in the MRF Tyres ICC Women’s Team Rankings.

Australia opened the series with a two-wicket win in Brisbane and increased the lead with a 75-run victory on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in Coffs Harbour before England won the final match by 20 runs at the same venue, also by the DLS method.

England had displaced Australia from the top ranking for the first time after the annual update earlier this month, starting the series ahead on decimal points with both teams on 128 points. But Australia made the most of the home conditions to prevail despite the absence of first-choice captain and leading batter Meg Lanning, going up to 129 points and ensuring a two-point lead in the process.

Teams get two points for each win, one point for a tie or no-result and no points for a loss in the ICC Women’s Championship, which will see ICC Women’s World Cup 2021 hosts New Zealand and the three other top teams gain direct qualification to ICC’s pinnacle women’s 50-over event.

The remaining four sides will get a second chance through the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier event. India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the Windies are the other sides in the ICC Women’s Championship, which runs till 2020.

In the first series of the ICC Women’s Championship, the Windies completed a 3-0 triumph over Sri Lanka to notch a full six points and lead the points table, Pakistan go head to head with New Zealand from Tuesday, while South Africa will play at home against India from 5 to 10 February 2018.

Australia captain Rachael Haynes was happy to secure four points from the high-profile series but did not expect an easy road ahead, especially playing in India later in the championship.</p>

<h2 class="text-uppercase">IPL 2017 Final: How Rohit Sharma And Mitchell Johnson Planned Steve Smith's Dismissal.</h2>
                  
<p class="item-intro text-muted">Batsmen make merry to pile on 180/3 before Amir leads the way as bowlers keep Sri Lanka to 144/9</p>
                  
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/Pakistan-Mohammad-Amir.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>Pakistan celebrated the return of big-time international cricket to the country with a victory over Sri Lanka by 36 runs in the third and final Twenty20 International amidst exhilarating scenes and tight security at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Sunday.

The win gave Pakistan its second 3-0 whitewash in a T20I series, the first coming against Windies in UAE last year.

With Pakistan winning the first two matches played in Abu Dhabi, the final match was highlighted by Sri Lanka’s return to the city where the team had been attacked by gunmen in March 2009. Those attacks, which left eight people dead and seven Sri Lanka players and staff injured, meant international cricket in Pakistan was suspended, and the team played its home matches in the UAE.

As part of efforts to revive cricket in the country, Pakistan had hosted Zimbabwe for a five-match limited over series in 2015 followed by the final of the Pakistan Super League and a three-match T20I series with a World XI comprising of players from seven countries -- both this year.

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, termed the match ‘historic’.

"It's a great honour and a great pleasure to welcome the honourable president of Sri Lanka Cricket and his team led by Thisara Perera to Pakistan. This is really a historic occasion. Nine years ago there was a tragedy which we wish to forget and this is the beginning of that journey of moving on," said Sethi.

Thilanga Sumathipala, the SLC president, vowed his board would not leave Pakistan in isolation. "We are happy and privileged to be here to support Pakistan cricket," said Sumathipala. "It's a wonderful cricketing nation. Pakistan has done so much for world cricket and to sports in general so we cannot leave them in isolation."

On the field, Pakistan had a blistering 57-run opening stand in the first eight overs with Umar Amin and Fakhar Zaman (31) hitting aggressive shots. Sri Lanka’s bowlers were clueless against the two left-handers. Amin's 37-ball knock had one six and three boundaries as he justified his first chance in place of the off-colour Ahmed Shehzad.

Once the openers were gone, Shoaib Malik and Babar Azam gave some real impetus to the innings. Malik, the only player from both sides to have featured in the fateful 2009 Test series which ended after the attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus, enjoyed the occasion with a 24-ball 51. One of his two sixes took him to fifty, and he added 75 for the third wicket with Azam in just 45 balls. Azam finished with a 31-ball 34. Faheem Ashraf smashed two sixes in his 13 as Pakistan took 23 runs in the last over bowled by Vikum Sanjaya to reach 180 for 3.

Then Mohammad Amir, the pace spearhead, celebrated his first international match at home with a career best 4 for 13 in his four overs as Sri Lanka was restricted to 144 for 9 in their 20 overs.

Ashraf took two wickets and Sri Lanka lost wickets at regular intervals, with only Dasun Shanaka chipping in with a 36-ball 54 with five boundaries and three sixes.</p>

<p>India captain Virat Kohli has moved back to the top position among batsmen in the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Player Rankings within 10 days of losing it to South Africa batsman AB de Villiers.

In the latest rankings update that takes into account India’s home series against New Zealand which India won 2-1 on Sunday, as well as the last match of the South Africa-Bangladesh series and the last two matches of the Pakistan-Sri Lanka series, Kohli has also reached a career-high in terms of rating points.

The 28-year-old Delhi batsman, who scored 263 runs in the series against New Zealand including knocks of 121 in the first ODI in Mumbai and 113 in the final ODI in Kanpur, has reached 889 points, which is the best ever by an India batsman. The previous highest points tally of 887 was managed by Sachin Tendulkar in 1998 and by Kohli earlier this year.

India opener Rohit Sharma’s 174 runs in the series against New Zealand, which included a fine 147 in the final match, has seen him reach a career-high rating of 799 points, even though he remains in seventh position. Similarly, Pakistan’s Babar Azam (fourth position) and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock (fifth position) have also attained their highest in terms of rating points.

South Africa batsman Faf du Plessis (up two places to 8th), former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (up one place to 11th), New Zealand batsman Tom Latham (up 15 places to a career-best 23rd), Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed (up three places to 37th) and Sri Lanka’s Lahiru Thirimanne (up six places to 47th) are among the batsmen to move up in the rankings.

The list for bowlers continues to be led by Pakistan pace bowler Hasan Ali while India pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah has reached a career-best third position after finishing with six wickets in the series against New Zealand..</p>

<h2 class="text-uppercase">Australia gain crucial points, regain top ranking after series win over England</h2>
                                 
 <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/Australia-team.jpg" alt="">
                  
<p>Mithali Raj regains top spot after Meg Lanning misses series due to injury; Knight, Healy, Hartley and Schutt among players to attain career-best rankings.
Defending champions Australia’s 2-1 victory over England in the ICC Women’s Championship series has not only helped them garner four useful points but also regain the top spot in the MRF Tyres ICC Women’s Team Rankings.

Australia opened the series with a two-wicket win in Brisbane and increased the lead with a 75-run victory on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in Coffs Harbour before England won the final match by 20 runs at the same venue, also by the DLS method.

England had displaced Australia from the top ranking for the first time after the annual update earlier this month, starting the series ahead on decimal points with both teams on 128 points. But Australia made the most of the home conditions to prevail despite the absence of first-choice captain and leading batter Meg Lanning, going up to 129 points and ensuring a two-point lead in the process.

Teams get two points for each win, one point for a tie or no-result and no points for a loss in the ICC Women’s Championship, which will see ICC Women’s World Cup 2021 hosts New Zealand and the three other top teams gain direct qualification to ICC’s pinnacle women’s 50-over event.

The remaining four sides will get a second chance through the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier event. India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the Windies are the other sides in the ICC Women’s Championship, which runs till 2020.

In the first series of the ICC Women’s Championship, the Windies completed a 3-0 triumph over Sri Lanka to notch a full six points and lead the points table, Pakistan go head to head with New Zealand from Tuesday, while South Africa will play at home against India from 5 to 10 February 2018.

Australia captain Rachael Haynes was happy to secure four points from the high-profile series but did not expect an easy road ahead, especially playing in India later in the championship.</p>
